I guess then the regret I have is being so angry for years afterwards—there were nice guys in grad school who would want to talk with me or ask me out, and I never felt pretty enough or I felt like fighting with them verbally—all this I know has to be from my belief in what was inherently wrong on the personal/spiritual level.

However, not completing my bachelor's degree while still in my twenties would be my one significant regret.\r\n\r\nAt the time, I'd finished my dental hygiene education and passed the licensing exam. It would have taken an additional year and a 30 minute commute for classes, to earn a BS in Dental Hygiene. I was ready to start earning and couldn't see a financial benefit to a degree in that field. In 1988, I stopped practicing dental hygiene - to raise those great kids - and eventually completed a BS in Liberal Studies with a minor in English in 2010.\r\n\r\nWhat made a regret out of the postponement of my degree, is that I always felt a bit \"less than\" for not reaching a definitive finish line with my education. I was an Air Force officer's wife and found that I related better to my children's pediatrician than to other wives. I more than made up for my lack of education by being a tireless freelance volunteer, but that energy probably stemmed from a small pilot light of interest in continuing my education.\r\n\r\nThanks for asking.

My family had a lot going on at that time, and my flute study since 5th grade had provided me with a sense of self and belonging that kept me afloat. On the day of that recital, however, I was feeling really down and perhaps nervous about the recital. My stomach hurt. I told my Mom I felt sick, and she allowed me to stay home. When I returned to school the next day, I found out that my tough-as-nails hard-ass impossible-to-please band instructor gave awards at the recital - and I was one of the awardees. I felt shy, but I asked about it. He declined to give me the award, had a few choice words about me not showing up. I felt shamed by the experience. A quiet kid who kept a pretty low-profile, being acknowledged for my flute playing would have been the highlight of my life. I've wondered what would have happened had I been there and experienced that? How would I have felt differently about myself through my early teen years? Would I have stuck with flute/performance rather than quitting at 16?
