Regrets are a universal part of the human experience. All of us have something we wish we had done differently – or some action we wish we had taken or not taken.

For a [book about regret](), author Daniel Pink has been collecting regrets from all over the world. So far, more than 15,000 people from 105 countries have contributed.

Would you be willing to participate? The simple survey takes about 3 minutes. Your responses are anonymous.  And we think you’ll find the experience interesting and meaningful.
