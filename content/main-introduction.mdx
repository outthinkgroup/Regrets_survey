Regrets are a universal part of the human experience. All of us have something we wish we had done differently â€“ or some action we wish we had taken or not taken.

For the last 18 months, author Daniel Pink has been collecting regrets from all over the world. So, far more than 19,000 people from 105 countries have contributed.
