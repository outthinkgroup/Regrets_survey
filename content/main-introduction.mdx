Regrets are a universal part of the human experience. All of us have something we wish we had done differently – or some action we wish we had taken or not taken.

For a book to help people better understand their regrets, author Daniel Pink is collecting regrets from all over the world. This simple survey takes about 3 minutes. Your responses are anonymous. Please consider participating. We think you’ll find the experience interesting and meaningful.
