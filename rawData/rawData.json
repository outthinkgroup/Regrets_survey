My friends who went to state schools are just as successful, if not more successful, than me, so I kick myself for collecting so much debt through a decision I made at 18 when had no idea what I wanted to do with my life. There are so many things I want to do and see - even alternate careers, but a massive cloud of debt (not only my own debt, but also my parents' contribution/investment) looms over my head at every decision. I don't think my dad's advice of \"it will pay off!\" is true so far, but maybe I'll change my mind one day.","QID3_TEXT":25,"QID2":1,"QID4":1,"QID6":16,"QID7_TEXT":"annaivonderhaar@gmail.com"},"labels":{"status":"IP Address","finished":"True","QID2":"Female","QID4":"United States","QID6":"Illinois"},"displayedFields":["QID7_TEXT","QID1_TEXT","QID2","QID3_TEXT","QID4","QID6"],"displayedValues":{"QID2":[1,2,3,4],"QID4":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1E+1,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,2E+1,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,3E+1,31,32,33,34,35,36,37,38,39,4E+1,41,42,43,44,45,46,47,48,49,5E+1,51,52,53,54,55,56,57,58,59,6E+1,61,62,63,64,65,66,67,68,69,7E+1,71,72,73,74,75,76,77,78,79,8E+1,81,82,83,84,85,86,87,88,89,9E+1,91,92,93,94,95,96,97,98,99,1E+2,101,102,103,104,105,106,107,108,109,1.1E+2,111,112,113,114,115,116,117,118,119,1.2E+2,121,122,123,124,125,126,127,128,129,1.3E+2,131,132,133,134,135,136,137,138,139,1.4E+2,141,142,143,144,145,146,147,148,149,1.5E+2,151,152,153,154,155,156,157,158,159,1.6E+2,161,162,163,164,165,166,167,168,169,1.7E+2,171,172,173,174,175,176,177,178,179,1.8E+2,181,182,183,184,185,186,187,188,189,1.9E+2,191,192,193,5.8E+2,1357,196],"QID6":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1E+1,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,2E+1,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,3E+1,31,32,33,34,35,36,37,38,39,4E+1,63,41,42,62,43,44,45,46,47,48,49,5E+1,51,52,53,54,55,56,57,58,59,6E+1,61,64]}},{"responseId":"R_3n2VMBgloOB8szC","values":{"startDate":"2020-07-13T20:26:49Z","endDate":"2020-07-13T20:33:47Z","status":0,"ipAddress":"75.11.9.74","progress":100,"duration":418,"finished":1,"recordedDate":"2020-07-13T20:33:48.190Z","_recordId":"R_3n2VMBgloOB8szC","locationLatitude":"37.8376007080078125","locationLongitude":"-122.23979949951171875","distributionChannel":"anonymous","userLanguage":"EN","QID1_TEXT":"Not following my gut instinct about my first wife.
