The music teacher contacted my parents and all three spent days imploring me to reconsider. I stubbornly refused. On the night of the performance, I regretted not being up on stage - the group appeared to be having so much fun. But the greater regret, the part that has stayed with me all my life, has been knowing that I didn’t take the chance that came my way because I succumbed to pressure from a person who felt no joy over my achievement; only bitterness as a result of her own disappointment.

greatest regret I have is listening to others tell me what my future goals should be, instead of following my passion.  I wanted to be an architect in high school and had really good talent and exceptional passion.  Instead, I was guided toward other fields that I had no interest in by people who refused to acknowledge my talents and interest.  This let to 7 different majors in my undergrad and 14 different career paths so far.  In my free time I still design as much as I can, but I don't have the credentials nor time left in my life to go into the field.  My entire adult work life has been a waste.  I've been very good at most every job I've had, but I've also hated every single one.  This has caused immense depression throughout my life.  Never living up to my own dreams and never really living up to anyone else's either.","QID3_TEXT":43,"QID2":2,"QID4":1,"QID6":16,"QID7_TEXT":"evanbrownsoc@gmail.com","QID1_TEXT_907fcab0db764e288194c351Sentiment":"Negative","QID1_TEXT_907fcab0db764e288194c351SenScore":-6,"QID1_TEXT_907fcab0db764e288194c351SenPol":1,"QID1_TEXT_907fcab0db764e288194c351Topics":["Unknown"]},"labels":{"status":"IP Address","finished":"True","QID2":"Male","QID4":"United States","QID6":"Illinois","QID1_TEXT_907fcab0db764e288194c351Topics":["Unknown"]},"displayedFields":["QID7_TEXT","QID1_TEXT","QID2","QID3_TEXT","QID4","QID6"],"displayedValues":{"QID2":[1,2,3,4],"QID4":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1E+1,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,2E+1,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,3E+1,31,32,33,34,35,36,37,38,39,4E+1,41,42,43,44,45,46,47,48,49,5E+1,51,52,53,54,55,56,57,58,59,6E+1,61,62,63,64,65,66,67,68,69,7E+1,71,72,73,74,75,76,77,78,79,8E+1,81,82,83,84,85,86,87,88,89,9E+1,91,92,93,94,95,96,97,98,99,1E+2,101,102,103,104,105,106,107,108,109,1.1E+2,111,112,113,114,115,116,117,118,119,1.2E+2,121,122,123,124,125,126,127,128,129,1.3E+2,131,132,133,134,135,136,137,138,139,1.4E+2,141,142,143,144,145,146,147,148,149,1.5E+2,151,152,153,154,155,156,157,158,159,1.6E+2,161,162,163,164,165,166,167,168,169,1.7E+2,171,172,173,174,175,176,177,178,179,1.8E+2,181,182,183,184,185,186,187,188,189,1.9E+2,191,192,193,5.8E+2,1357,196],"QID6":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1E+1,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,2E+1,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,3E+1,31,32,33,34,35,36,37,38,39,4E+1,63,41,42,62,43,44,45,46,47,48,49,5E+1,51,52,53,54,55,56,57,58,59,6E+1,61,64]}},{"responseId":"R_22LY1qEgLTEo2Wb","values":{"startDate":"2020-06-17T14:33:17Z","endDate":"2020-06-17T14:35:06Z","status":0,"ipAddress":"75.70.242.169","progress":100,"duration":109,"finished":1,"recordedDate":"2020-06-17T14:35:07.081Z","_recordId":"R_22LY1qEgLTEo2Wb","locationLatitude":"38.9488067626953125","locationLongitude":"-104.7677001953125","distributionChannel":"anonymous","userLanguage":"EN","QID1_TEXT":"I regret not staying in the military for more than 20 years because of a tiff I had with a commander.
