While away at college, I learned my parents were on Section 8. Their case manager bullied us into believing my financial aid was fair game in determining their eligibility for help. She mandated I attend their meetings and belittled us while there. I said nothing out of fear I would leave my parents homeless. I internalized my family as a leach on the gov’t, and my guilt to make up for it. It has impacted every major life decision. Ten years later, I found myself working for a major university. I made the mistake of having told of my background to my boss, who then shared that story with my unit's president. As is customary in this organization, I was introduced to the board of directors with new hires. Each was introduced with their professional accomplishments, except me. I was introduced as the girl who grew up on Section 8.
