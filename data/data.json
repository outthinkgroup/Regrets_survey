For example one time I went into a strip club with my business cards and on the back of them I wrote things like \"I bet you make a lot of money, are you making smart decisions about your financial future? Give me a call.\" on the back of the card. I am sure you can guess how many calls I received.\n\nWhen this advisor left I began calling his clients and having them come in to meet me. I saw they were in investments that might not have been appropriate, lack of diversification, higher ongoing costs, etc. \n\nI just realized I am going to run out of room.

My parents, without any real exploration of the program, decided they wouldn't let me go. Even though I was devastated, I was brought up to not challenge my parents. So I didn't push them to reconsider, and I didn't go. Years later I finally got the nerve to ask why; the response was \"we were concerned about your education.\" I know I would have received an amazing education that year; at the time they didn't even attempt to learn the details. It was a pivotal moment in my life trajectory, and it wasn't even my choice. While I don't dwell on it, I can't help wonder what my life would have been like had I been able to have this experience. Not going is the biggest regret of my life.",

I then dedicated my life to international trade and generally maintaining relations with other cultures. I do it well and  I’m pleased. Curiously, I’ve learned to set up complex contracts in the process, a closing of sorts  ",

Years ago, for a Christmas present, my teenage son gifted me a blank notebook and requested that I write stories in it that pop into my head when he wasn't there to listen to them ... and which I might forget to tell him.  Fast forward to now that he has own two children, he tells them of my \"big regret\".  Of course there's the occasional eye-roll  ... but they lovingly listen as he launches into his stories.  ",

By the grace of God, I landed a good job, can support myself, am blessed in every way, but have one regret-my decision to skip grad school. At my age, I can return to school, of course, but will not recover the money financially career-wise. As a director for a non-profit, I also don't have access to funds for someone else to finance this venture! I really would like to earn my master's degree as my four daughters also earn theirs!",
