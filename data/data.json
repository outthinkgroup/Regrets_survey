We stayed in touch, occasionally meeting for coffee, happy hour etc. She could even dance (ballroom) and delighted finding that I could as well. Once, at a Starbucks, we danced a impromptu two-step on the patio. We laughed and had fun.\nShe asked me several times to do other things with her but for various reasons (work, etc) I declined. I realize now these were important to her, activities that would have brought her joy that I could have easily done. Her illness returned and we had planned to walk an art fair together but she was too sick. I saw her once at the hospital and she died from cancer shortly after. I loved her so much.",

Finally, when I was about 35 a woman hit me with her car while I was riding my bike. I was knocked unconscious. I received a letter from an ambulance chasing lawyer and threw it away, priding myself on not being petty and vindictive. Later I was summonsed to court because the moron who hit me pleaded \"not guilty\" and I had to appear as a witness. I really regret not suing that cretin! I barely got any money from her insurers.",

If only I'd either had the courage to turn up for the exams on day one and taken my chances or stuck to my decision to drop out at the 11th hour and saved myself further humiliation. But I did neither. I took the coward's path - twice in succession. They say you regret the things you didn't do more than those you did. But my 'sin' was both of commission and omission.

He learned the feeding schedule and always showed up on time. I loved this cat and wanted to make him mine, but my husband and I already had 4 cats of our own. I regret not taking him in or at the very least catching him and taking him to a shelter. My husband and I finally got a house and moved out of state. I regrettably had to leave him behind.
