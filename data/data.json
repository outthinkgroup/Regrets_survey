I didn't even consider how much I had hurt him with my actions, I selfishly only considered how I felt when he left.  He told me that he did it for us.

In fact, they paid it so I didn't even have to pay a dime. Fast-forward starting from when we arrived at the big destination, it was already dark because of the different time zones. We first got to our hotel room. Then, the stepfather invited me to go out for a little while to get a meal. We sat there and there were a few shisha pumps that people were using. I talked a little bit about it to him, and then told me some things saying that it wouldn't make much difference if it was inhaled. He was confusing my brain and my state. Eventually, the decision in my mind was to do it and so I did. Just after, he did as well.\n\nREGRET",

But on the first day of finals I totally lost my nerve, panicked, missed the exams and went AWOL for a couple of days (regret 1). After tracking me down, my parents persuaded me to go back and complete the rest of my exams, which, out of guilt I did and so ended up with a mediocre degree (regret 2) - quite an achievement in the circumstances, I guess, but devastating for an incurable perfectionist like me. If only I'd either had the courage to turn up for the exams on day one and taken my chances or stuck to my decision to drop out at the 11th hour and saved myself further humiliation. But I did neither. I took the coward's path - twice in succession. They say you regret the things you didn't do more than those you did. But my 'sin' was both of commission and omission. After 40yrs, it's a double wound that has never healed. Time, you are not a great healer!",

Se hizo pipí en la cama en un momento muy inadecuado e inesperado. Recuerdo que llevaba un buen rato llorando, no recuerdo porqué, estaba cansada o aburrida y no quería salir. Cuando entré a la pieza a buscarla, estaba parada sobre la cama y se había hecho pipí. Yo no lo podía creer, la recriminé verbalmente y luego traje un trapo para que ella misma secara lo que había hecho. Todavía me duele cuando me acuerdo que le pedí eso. Creo que fue innecesario. ",

At first he hid under the properties dumpsters. There was a sign on it that said ‘keep out’. After feeding the cat for a while and becoming attached as it learned to trust me (slow process), I decided he needed a nickname of sorts. He became Keep Out from there and we grew to be great friends. He would eventually start coming right to our apartments door for his daily meals. He learned the feeding schedule and always showed up on time. I loved this cat and wanted to make him mine, but my husband and I already had 4 cats of our own. I regret not taking him in or at the very least catching him and taking him to a shelter. My husband and I finally got a house and moved out of state. I regrettably had to leave him behind. I think about him so often and I hope he found a loving and safe home. I miss him terribly. ",
