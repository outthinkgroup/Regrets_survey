More recent, I came across a young couple at a Post Office needing to buy postage after hours and the machine required a credit card. When they asked, I said I didn't have my wallet on me. Which was true, but what I didn't say was that my wallet was in my vehicle. Right away I wished I had not said that, and went back with my wallet to purchase their postage. It was around 2 dollars. I did not take the cash they offered. I probably had $20 to $30 cash in my wallet, and what I regret is that I didn't think to offer it to them. It has been a good month since, and I still kick myself for not thinking to offer the cash. I feel as though it was their money, that I was just holding it for them.",

The result was that the alcoholism got progressively worse in spite of 3 secret stays in rehab. I finally realized I couldn’t allow him to put me thru this so we divorced. He needed this—he needed to have no responsibility other than sobriety-even his family. He got sober! Then, 3 years later, he died of cancer. If only i’d faced the truth earlier, he would have gotten sober sooner and it would have possibly changed the course of the entire family.",
