That stoled our opportunity of creating an authentic relationship. The take away is this: is easier to repair a relation if someone is not comfortable with your truth in an specific moment in time, but is almost always more difficult to repair it if you speak your truth after years of giving them the impression you are someone else. Time gives opportunity for acceptance, on both sides. So, speak your truth self and you will gain more time to be your true self, it doesn't worth the risk of not telling it when you know it. ",
