This was combined with the reality of studying law. Not all of it is fun. There’s a lot of dry material you simply have to overcome. I hadn’t built my vision clearly enough to pull me through and evidently my resilience was low. I finally left and embarked on a never ending spree to learn everything I could about Business: sales, administration, marketing, exports, the works. I then dedicated my life to international trade and generally maintaining relations with other cultures. I do it well and  I’m pleased. Curiously, I’ve learned to set up complex contracts in the process, a closing of sorts  ",

It was a strange feeling to feel so connected by looking at the sequence of their life in pictures and to truly get a sense of who they are. In life he had often annoyed me and we clashed a lot - I never gave him my time 💯 or attention fully as I was always “so busy”. I wish with every.single.cell of my body that I could have my time with him again. To let him know how loved he is. \nMy regret is not seeing him for the beautiful soul he was in life. For never just sitting with him or calling him to really find out how he really was. I miss you my beautiful brother every day. \nHold those you love close and find  space & time for those who might flourish with some love. ",

I decided to not continue my study in the college out of state and instead start all over again in the local college here entering the same major. I just regretted that i didnt listen to myself and wasted one year of my study because i could've just graduated in 3 years. I really wish i could go back in time and choose more wisely.",
