We stayed in touch, occasionally meeting for coffee, happy hour etc. She could even dance (ballroom) and delighted finding that I could as well. Once, at a Starbucks, we danced a impromptu two-step on the patio. We laughed and had fun.\nShe asked me several times to do other things with her but for various reasons (work, etc) I declined. I realize now these were important to her, activities that would have brought her joy that I could have easily done. Her illness returned and we had planned to walk an art fair together but she was too sick. I saw her once at the hospital and she died from cancer shortly after. I loved her so much.",

This was combined with the reality of studying law. Not all of it is fun. There’s a lot of dry material you simply have to overcome. I hadn’t built my vision clearly enough to pull me through and evidently my resilience was low. I finally left and embarked on a never ending spree to learn everything I could about Business: sales, administration, marketing, exports, the works. I then dedicated my life to international trade and generally maintaining relations with other cultures. I do it well and  I’m pleased. Curiously, I’ve learned to set up complex contracts in the process, a closing of sorts  ",

I do not fully regret it though, as I still gained, but it did confuse me for a while and I do wonder how my life would have panned out if I didn't listen to them and their concerns and advice and just went on to do what my initial inspiration told me to. Thank you for this opportunity, would love to see how this turns out! Good luck and follow your heart :)",

He thought it was a useless and worthless degree if it came from a local college and not from a prestigious one . I hesitated and decided to chose to go out of state because i felt embarassed if i didnt because of what my uncle said. Now, i regret it because what i was concern with going out of state for college is coming true (transportation and living fees ) and becoming a hinderance to me. I decided to not continue my study in the college out of state and instead start all over again in the local college here entering the same major. I just regretted that i didnt listen to myself and wasted one year of my study because i could've just graduated in 3 years. I really wish i could go back in time and choose more wisely.",
