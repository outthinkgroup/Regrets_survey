This one action completely and permanently changed the courses of both our lives, and has had repercussions to this day, more than 30 years later.\n\nI throw this confession\"out to the universe.

Those explorations were never that enjoyable, but he eventually would not put up with it anymore. When he ended things, I was heartbroken and realized the mistake immediately. As I write this, it sounds clearly like a moral regret, but it resonates with me as a boldness regret. I regret not trying that very night to change the situation, to profess my undying love, ask for forgiveness, and ask for another chance. I rationalized that he would not take me back. He had decided. I also regret several other occasions where I could have made a bold declaration to him before we both ended up married to different people and with kids. ",

I was fearful because my client at the time had screwed me over on a contract, my parents were struggling to make ends meat because they hadn’t planned for retirement, and ultimately I wasn’t confident in my own skills and ability to save for retirement. The employee position I took offered a defined pension program that would ensure I had money for retirement, but had I continued to work as a consultant I would have made significantly more money and could have built up my own retirement plan with the help of my financial advisor.

I decided to not continue my study in the college out of state and instead start all over again in the local college here entering the same major. I just regretted that i didnt listen to myself and wasted one year of my study because i could've just graduated in 3 years. I really wish i could go back in time and choose more wisely.",

Sexual orientation and support is another evolution that could have been smoother with a parental figure closer. Today I am looking at throwing out a USD 350k annual job to be close to my family.",

They said: it’s none of our business you are not in your small town anymore, this happens everywhere and they kept walking.\n\nWhen I couldn’t convince them to help her, and I didn’t try hard, I kept walking.

Even if I got hurt trying wounds would’ve been healed by now.\n\nI thinks that made me slightly a better person. 10 years laters, I found my self fighting for a woman at work knowing that my relation with my superiors will be impacted",
