We talked as adults and he told me that he had every intention of marrying me, I told him that I wish he would've told me that at the time; but I can't be sure it would've made a difference.  I am glad that we had a chance to talk about this as adults though.  I apologized to him.  I didn't even consider how much I had hurt him with my actions, I selfishly only considered how I felt when he left.  He told me that he did it for us.  He wanted to be sure he could take care of us.  He's happily married, the guy I left him for is happily married.  I am sad and alone.  ",

I found one and my boyfriend moved in with me over the summer so I didn’t have to be alone until she arrived in the fall. We bonded as a couple and it was awkward when she moved in for fall semester. I had a conversation with my then boyfriend and I asked her to move out. I remember her telling me it was really cold what I was doing and I really screwed up her housing for school that year. I lost a friend and didn’t stay married to the guy in the long run anyway. I often think back on that and wish I had made a different choice. That decision was pivotal in my life and one I made consciously. There are other things I regret but they were often out of my control.

He was halfway across the country in college, and we never met in person, but we communicated for years via letters. When he had an opportunity to travel, he made arrangements to come meet me in person. However, I had recently met someone who I thought was my first real boyfriend. Instead of telling my pen pal, I stopped communicating with him, and didn’t have the courage to face him, even though the other relationship quickly fizzled. I don’t even know if he made it to my hometown. My big regret is throwing away something that was so meaningful because of an infatuation that wasn’t real.",

FYI: I've always made my 'big regret' known to my own kids & grandkids. And they would lovingly humor me (with an occasional rolling-of-the-eyes) by listening to my stories.  Years ago, for a Christmas present, my teenage son gifted me a blank notebook and requested that I write stories in it that pop into my head when he wasn't there to listen to them ... and which I might forget to tell him.  Fast forward to now that he has own two children, he tells them of my \"big regret\".  Of course there's the occasional eye-roll  ... but they lovingly listen as he launches into his stories.  ",
