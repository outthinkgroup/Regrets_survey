Then I lost my job and we had to downsize our house because we had no emergency savings (because of me.) I started a new career moving from corporate finance (something I hated but did for 25 years because I loved the money and prestige.) to marketing. That was my first degree and something I should have stuck with. I was depressed and filled with shame. Started taking Xanax and proceeded to get TWO DUIs. One was dismissed but the second one stuck. My husband and I separated for 6 weeks in 2017. We have reunited, and I am finally making a good living doing what I ENJOY. My true gifting. I can see God's hand on me through this process. I know I am forgiven by the grace of God and my husband says he is proud of me. Yet I still cannot believe what I was capable of. And Satan is a crafty bastard. Thanks for listening!",

After tracking me down, my parents persuaded me to go back and complete the rest of my exams, which, out of guilt I did and so ended up with a mediocre degree (regret 2) - quite an achievement in the circumstances, I guess, but devastating for an incurable perfectionist like me. If only I'd either had the courage to turn up for the exams on day one and taken my chances or stuck to my decision to drop out at the 11th hour and saved myself further humiliation. But I did neither. I took the coward's path - twice in succession. They say you regret the things you didn't do more than those you did. But my 'sin' was both of commission and omission.

FYI: I've always made my 'big regret' known to my own kids & grandkids. And they would lovingly humor me (with an occasional rolling-of-the-eyes) by listening to my stories.  Years ago, for a Christmas present, my teenage son gifted me a blank notebook and requested that I write stories in it that pop into my head when he wasn't there to listen to them ... and which I might forget to tell him.  Fast forward to now that he has own two children, he tells them of my \"big regret\".  Of course there's the occasional eye-roll  ... but they lovingly listen as he launches into his stories.  ",

We married, and once our first child was born, mutually decided I would leave my career and become a full-time mom. 3 more children came along, and we decided to homeschool. It was a wonderful experience with no regrets, however, we divorced after 25 years.

At my age, I can return to school, of course, but will not recover the money financially career-wise. As a director for a non-profit, I also don't have access to funds for someone else to finance this venture! I really would like to earn my master's degree as my four daughters also earn theirs!",
