This was combined with the reality of studying law. Not all of it is fun. There’s a lot of dry material you simply have to overcome. I hadn’t built my vision clearly enough to pull me through and evidently my resilience was low. I finally left and embarked on a never ending spree to learn everything I could about Business: sales, administration, marketing, exports, the works. I then dedicated my life to international trade and generally maintaining relations with other cultures. I do it well and  I’m pleased. Curiously, I’ve learned to set up complex contracts in the process, a closing of sorts  ",

Now, i regret it because what i was concern with going out of state for college is coming true (transportation and living fees ) and becoming a hinderance to me. I decided to not continue my study in the college out of state and instead start all over again in the local college here entering the same major. I just regretted that i didnt listen to myself and wasted one year of my study because i could've just graduated in 3 years. I really wish i could go back in time and choose more wisely.",

Being highly sensitive ( thing I knew only recently through therapy) I was drawn to various fields: science, literature, arts but didn't excel in any due to lack of support. This makes me angry that I didn't have the psychological support I needed back then. I also chose smoking over sports. I smoked for almost 20 years of my life and quitting was the best gift I could give to myself. I am proud of who I am today, but I do have those regrets. Even today, I struggle with adopting healthy habits.  ",
