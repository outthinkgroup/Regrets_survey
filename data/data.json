After tracking me down, my parents persuaded me to go back and complete the rest of my exams, which, out of guilt I did and so ended up with a mediocre degree (regret 2) - quite an achievement in the circumstances, I guess, but devastating for an incurable perfectionist like me. If only I'd either had the courage to turn up for the exams on day one and taken my chances or stuck to my decision to drop out at the 11th hour and saved myself further humiliation. But I did neither. I took the coward's path - twice in succession. They say you regret the things you didn't do more than those you did. But my 'sin' was both of commission and omission. After 40yrs, it's a double wound that has never healed. Time, you are not a great healer!",

I then dedicated my life to international trade and generally maintaining relations with other cultures. I do it well and  I’m pleased.

Se hizo pipí en la cama en un momento muy inadecuado e inesperado. Recuerdo que llevaba un buen rato llorando, no recuerdo porqué, estaba cansada o aburrida y no quería salir. Cuando entré a la pieza a buscarla, estaba parada sobre la cama y se había hecho pipí.

After feeding the cat for a while and becoming attached as it learned to trust me (slow process), I decided he needed a nickname of sorts. He became Keep Out from there and we grew to be great friends. He would eventually start coming right to our apartments door for his daily meals. He learned the feeding schedule and always showed up on time. I loved this cat and wanted to make him mine, but my husband and I already had 4 cats of our own. I regret not taking him in or at the very least catching him and taking him to a shelter. My husband and I finally got a house and moved out of state. I regrettably had to leave him behind. I think about him so often and I hope he found a loving and safe home. I miss him terribly. ",
