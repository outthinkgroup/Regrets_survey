This one action completely and permanently changed the courses of both our lives, and has had repercussions to this day, more than 30 years later.\n\nI throw this confession\"out to the universe.

They said: it’s none of our business you are not in your small town anymore, this happens everywhere and they kept walking.\n\nWhen I couldn’t convince them to help her, and I didn’t try hard, I kept walking. At the end, I couldn’t have  handled them myself.\n\nTill now, I keep thinking about this situation, I could have helped her and my group will be forced to help me if I needed any help. Even if I got hurt trying wounds would’ve been healed by now.\n\nI thinks that made me slightly a better person. 10 years laters, I found my self fighting for a woman at work knowing that my relation with my superiors will be impacted",
