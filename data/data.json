He's doing well - he was in a safe place when he moved, he graduated from high school, gone through some time figuring out what he's wanted to do - now he's in college. I want connection, but need to be careful bcs he needs to choose to connect - I don't want to push him away. I want to be connected to know how his school is going - he won't respond. I've tried - he contacts me once in a while, and we have a nice conversation/exchange. I will apologize - that's all I can do. ",

And I felt unheard in my marriage, though I very much love(d) David and very much needed him to hear me and help me. I may have started the sexual part, because I was manic, highly sexual, wanting to please, and have fun. The cascade of damage to myself and my family that my relationship with him caused is incalculable. When I called him out on another relationship outside his marriage that I believed he was having, he lashed out. Then he or his friends hacked all my electronics. I became paranoid, suicidal, went to the hospital, had ECT. And since have moved on, although it's been an uphill battle frought with trauma. I forgive him for all this. God forgive me. ",

But that's what it took to propel me into my own business, I never looked backed. Now 11 years later I am in awe of my success by God's grace but with all the signs to leave if I had leave sooner I would have been well ahead of where I am now. So my lesson when you see the signs that it's time to leave whether its a job or someone don't delay because the pain of staying is often times greater than the pain of leaving.",
