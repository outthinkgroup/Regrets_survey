I wish I had had the courage to call him and go for a walk or dinner and ask him why he'd ended our relationship. We were very serious and then it ended while I was studying abroad and he had moved away for a job after college. I've never really gotten over that heartbreak. And I still kick myself for not being more mature and confident in having that conversation. One evening I did run into him at a bar but there was no meaningful conversation or resolution. I just acted like I didn't care, then spent some time with him, and he broke my heart again. Terribly painful and I still didn't insist on more of an explanation. Young and proud.

So, I found a leadership position in a different company that after 6 months in it, I resigned once again due to toxic supervisor.  I was so depressed.  Sometimes I wish I just swallowed my ego, tried it out since the pay was so good without being in a leadership position and I loved the team I was in.

I decided to not continue my study in the college out of state and instead start all over again in the local college here entering the same major. I just regretted that i didnt listen to myself and wasted one year of my study because i could've just graduated in 3 years. I really wish i could go back in time and choose more wisely.",

As they entered college in the last three years they certainly needed an emotional orientation and support that I did not even realize was needed. Obviously the money earned eased tgeir life but the fact of not being present has eaten me with fault and regret. Looking back I most probably would have made a larger effort to anticipate the way back home to Portugal from Angola. Doubt arises in the senae of, if tgos would have changed anything, for better or worse? But the fact that some of their choices have proven emitionally hard, either in terms of effort to evolve in the academic set or, in the case of the second, exactly the oposite or the lack of academic achievement are an example. Sexual orientation and support is another evolution that could have been smoother with a parental figure closer. Today I am looking at throwing out a USD 350k annual job to be close to my family.",
